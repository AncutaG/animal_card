            <p class='description'>Originally from Wales, the Pembroke Welsh Corgis are the oldest herding breed. These medium-sized and medium-energy
                dogs can grow between 25-27 pounds and live an average of 11-13 years. The breed is classified by the American
                Kennel Club as a member of the Herding group. Don't be scared if you will be herded too, just choose to love
                me as I am.
